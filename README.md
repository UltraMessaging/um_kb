# Why a Knowledge Base?


Q: Why put stuff in a knowledge base (KB) and not in the product doc?

A: Some stuff just doesn't belong in the product doc.
For example, a work-in-progress can be in the KB and provide some benefit
to customers even though it is incomplete.
Also, it is MUCH MUCH quicker to throw something up on the KB than to
incorporate it into the product doc.
It is quite possible that some KB articles will grow in content and
maturity and graduate into being doc sections.

Q: Why not use the Informatica KB?

A: UM is a small product offering from Informatica.
We are a relatively small team as compared to the larger Informatica
product offerings.
The overhead of using the Informatica tools is proper and necessary for
teams the size of other Informatica teams,
but for UM the overhead is unnecessary and onerous.
This KB allows us to get information out to our customers quickly and
efficiently
